# Passwordless Login Using Xamarin Forms and Twilio SMS

This project implements a passwordless login workflow using Xamarin.Forms that works with the backend in [this repo](https://github.com/brentschooley/PasswordlessAuth).

## Setup

Before running the application you'll need to edit `PhoneNumberPage.xaml.cs` and `TokenPage.xaml.cs` to update the backend URL to match your running [backend](https://github.com/brentschooley/PasswordlessAuth).
